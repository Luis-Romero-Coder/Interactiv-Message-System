## Index

This is some html code that I used to have an easy way to start the JS code.


## Interactive Messages System

Here is the main code where all the functionality of the page is.

The functionality is the next:

I create a let varible named "turn" to ativate the while that contain the main code. Then I create 2 function the first one is a function to validate the name that avoid numbers and white spaces and the second one is a funtion to validate age that avoid letters, an age less that 0 and white spaces. Then comes the main code there I ask to the user his name and age then I call the functions to validate each one. Based in the information suministred by the user I give him a short message that depends on the age. After I ask to the user if he want to continue in the app then if he type thing than isn't "yes" the app close.
